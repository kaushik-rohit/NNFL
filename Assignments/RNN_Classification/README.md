# Text Classification using LSTM

## Task

Text Classification of verbs ands adjectives

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two text files (verb.txt and adjective.txt)

## Approach

1. Import libraries, and set seed to 420
2. Load the text files
3. Convert everything to lower case
4. Create vocabulary (character-to-index dict and the reverse)
5. Initialise X and Y NumPy arrays with correct shape 
6. Fill X and Y arrays appropriately
7. Build a Keras model (Careful with return sequence)
8. Train

## Evaluation

Groups of two
Accuracy on whole dataset will be checked (Due to shortage of time and problem nature)
